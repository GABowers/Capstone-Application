Things to add:

Documentation
Second order
Advanced neighbor type - Pretty much complete
Re-add grid types - cylinder, torus
Add place in UI to check/display number of each cell type in the program rather than requiring an outside document
Adjust tooltip lengths

talked to Dan (did not) - consider adding update to StatePageInfo when moving between tabs. For advanced neighborhood, would require refactoring
to allow for addition of StatePageInfos without knowing the exact number of rows and columns.
