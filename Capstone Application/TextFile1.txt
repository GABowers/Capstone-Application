Things to add:

Documentation
Second order
-gravity, random walks, cell faces, agent attraction, joined agent transitions ("reactions")
1D? 3D?
Advanced neighbor type - Pretty much complete
Re-add grid types - cylinder, torus
Possible add in plots or tables of cell counts? Real time.
Adjust tooltip lengths or simply put all that info in the documentation
Change how the CA is started, so auxilary services like the cell counter window can function properly without starting the CA
Consider allowing user to change filetypes (of auto-saved images)
Think about making setup more extensible - changing where the grid size is made so users can adjust it on the fly,
    making the initial numbers percentages to support this, etc.
IMPORTANT: How many directions should agents be able to move? Just 4 regular, or the diagonals too?
Add way to slow down simulation--to have it run X times per second or something.
    Start a timer at the beginning of the iteration, then check if it's been that amount of time before beginning next one.
Vector-based graphics for 

consider adding update to StatePageInfo when moving between tabs. For advanced neighborhood, would require refactoring
to allow for addition of StatePageInfos without knowing the exact number of rows and columns.
