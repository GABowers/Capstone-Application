Things to add:

Documentation
Second order
1D? 3D?
Advanced neighbor type - Pretty much complete
Re-add grid types - cylinder, torus
Add place in UI (new form) to check/display number of each cell type in the program in real time rather than requiring an outside document Mostly Done
Possible add in plots or tables of cell counts?
--Add recording transitions--how many of type A transitioned to type B and so on
Adjust tooltip lengths or simply put all that info in the documentation
Change how the CA is started, so auxilary services like the cell counter window can function properly without starting the CA
Consider allowing user to change filetypes (of auto-saved images)

talked to Dan (did not) - consider adding update to StatePageInfo when moving between tabs. For advanced neighborhood, would require refactoring
to allow for addition of StatePageInfos without knowing the exact number of rows and columns.
