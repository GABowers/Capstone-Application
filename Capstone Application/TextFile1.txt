Things to add:

Documentation
Second order
-gravity, random walks, cell faces, agent attraction, joined agent transitions ("reactions")
1D? 3D?
Re-add grid types - cylinder, torus
Possible add in plots or tables of cell counts? Real time.
Change how the CA is started, so auxilary services like the cell counter window can function properly without starting the CA
Consider allowing user to change filetypes (of auto-saved images)
Think about making setup more extensible - changing where the grid size is made so users can adjust it on the fly,
    making the initial numbers percentages to support this, etc.
IMPORTANT: How many directions should agents be able to move? Just 4 regular, or the diagonals too?
Vector-based graphics for multi-faced agents

consider adding update to StatePageInfo when moving between tabs. For advanced neighborhood, would require refactoring
to allow for addition of StatePageInfos without knowing the exact number of rows and columns.
