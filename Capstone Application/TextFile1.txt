Things to add:

Documentation
Second order
- cell faces, agent attraction, joined agent transitions ("reactions")
1D? 3D?
Possible add in plots or tables of cell counts? Real time.
- have plot going out to 10, 25, 100, 250, etc iterations (shift min size when prev. goes to 10 increments). When you hit the current max
  add another increment (when you hit 500, add 100 steps so 600 total shown) and rescale
Change how the CA is started, so auxilary services like the cell counter window can function properly without starting the CA
Consider allowing user to change filetypes (of auto-saved images)
Think about making setup more extensible - changing where the grid size is made so users can adjust it on the fly,
    making the initial numbers percentages to support this, etc.
Vector-based graphics for multi-faced agents

consider adding update to StatePageInfo when moving between tabs. For advanced neighborhood, would require refactoring
to allow for addition of StatePageInfos without knowing the exact number of rows and columns.

Add "template" system. Select template when adding grid, which changes settings. For ants, CA=second order, grid=box,
    neighborhood = something, agents = variable (3 or more, with 1 = colony, 2 = food, 3 = ants, 4 = obstacle), grid size editable
For template system, incorporate macro system, allowing user to select various options for when they arrive at X iteration
Add line at beginning of count file, stating run and date?
Heatmap/trace how to show multiple agents

Completely revamp how a CA is made. Make it so you only define the grid size and number of agents initially (maybe not even grid size).
    for each agent, define whether it's mobile or immobile, its neighborhood, whether it has any prob. of change (for mobile mainly) or
	sticking effects/random walk/whatever.
Change "count" to "amount"
grid not expanding all the way in larger places
picture control not showing grid of height 1
moving the mouse over the picturebox still shows coordinates, even when outside of grid
